## Setting up tsc project
To set up a TypeScript project, follow these steps:
1. **Initialize a new project**: Run `tsc --init` in your terminal. This will create a `tsconfig.json` file in your project directory.

2. **Configure your `tsconfig.json`**: Open the `tsconfig.json` file and adjust the settings according to your project needs. For example, you can specify the root directory, output directory, and compiler options.

3. **Create TypeScript files**: Start writing your TypeScript code in `.ts` files within your project directory.

4. **Compile TypeScript files**: To compile your TypeScript files, run the following command in your terminal:
   ```bash
   tsc
   ```
   This will compile all `.ts` files in your project according to the settings specified in `tsconfig.json`.
